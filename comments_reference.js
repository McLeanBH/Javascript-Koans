// I am closing the issue now, but I still have not had the opportunity to work through these like I would like to & as I plan to.
// just trying to get caught up to speed in regards to my HW submissions, so that we may discuss during our 1-on-1 for my performance assessment.

// (personal notes)
// 11pm on Tuesday, I am ~ half way through the exercises, finished all sections of AboutFxns
// Will resume tomorrow, applying necessary changes to 'HigherOrderFxns' 'Inheritance' & 'Mutability'
// - once I can actually think straight again. Unable to retain all that I am leanring at the moment, and this is without a doubt (if not the most) one of the most beneficial assignments provided thus far.
//
//
// ****DONT FORGET *********
// update (unposted) blog. Have not made an update since the middle of last week, and much as occurred since then, including
// working in our first group assignment, building the chat app, learning new terminal applications and methods such as gitX and zsh
// - discuss how the first month of the course has unfolded, perform a personal SWOT analysis of my skills and areas that need improvement
